Visualization in two main parts: 
Part 1 consist of Global competitiveness of index vs GDP of countries. 
Part 2 consist of comparison table of multiple countries selected by the user. 

Below are the key features of the of our visualisation

Multi country selection and comparison: 
	The unique feature of our visualization is instead of comparing 2 countries we can compare more than 2 countries. Dealing with multi-dimensional datasets with typically more than two attributes start causing problems, since our medium of data analysis and communication is typically restricted to two dimensions. It is quite easy to contrast and compare these statistical measures for the 12 pillars of the competitive index of different countries through tabular format.

Missing values handled: 
	We have removed the empty GCI values of the country for all years and those having values of few years its wighted average filled in place GCI values. 
	This helped us scaling the ranges of y scale’s global competitive index in a better way.

Custom Data Viewing: 
	We can view a particular year’s data by typing year in the textbox provided and hitting on the [Search] button.

Country trails of previous years: 
	One of the design rationale for the multi-variate visualisation we have used trails. On clicking over the bubble of any particular country the entire trace history of the country over the years can be visualized

Individual Country Data Visualisation: 
	Upon hovering the mouse pointer on particular country’s bubble we can see all the data of that particular country 

Improved Readability: 
	We have improved the readability of the data points by converting them up to 3 decimal places.

Reset to Default: 
	We have given a reset button which restores everything to default visualization and user can restart comparison from the beginning.
